# QR-Code-Generator

This repository contains a QR Code Generator web application built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript (with jQuery). The app allows users to input custom content in a text field, and upon clicking the "Generate" button, a QR code is created based on the input. The user interface is clean and easy to use, with Bootstrap 3.3.7 for styling and responsive design.

Main components of the application:

index.html: The HTML file containing the structure of the web application, including an input field for entering custom content, a "Generate" button, and an area for displaying the generated QR code.
style.css: The CSS file for styling the user interface, including a light blue background and centered text.
script.js: The JavaScript file that handles user input, encodes the input into a QR code, and updates the displayed QR code image.
To use the QR Code Generator, simply open index.html in a web browser, enter your desired content in the text field, and click the "Generate" button to create a QR code based on the input.
